title: Lifecycle Identity in Runme
---

Runme introduces a powerful new feature known as Lifecycle Identity. This feature assigns unique identifiers and versions to a cell, or your entire markdown file, or both. By adding a lifecycle identity, you can track changes, versions and the history of your documents. 

 Stay organized and in control of your files within Runme! üöÄ

### Configuration

To activate the Lifecycle Identity feature in Runme, follow these steps:

* Navigate to Runme's [Extension Settings](../getting-started/vs-code#runme-settings-for-vs-code) on the your [VS code](../install#runme-for-vs-code). click on the ‚Äúsettings‚Äù icon and select ‚ÄúExtension Settings‚Äù. The Runme extension can be found in the extension toolbar at the left side on your screen.
* Next, choose the tracking level by selecting the document you wish to enable lifecycle identity tracking.

As shown in the image above, there are three levels of tracking available:

* [Cell level](../configuration/cell-level): Tracks changes within each individual cell in a document.
* [Document level](../configuration/document-level): Monitors the entire document for any modifications or version changes.
* All: Track changes made to both [Cell level](../configuration/cell-level) and [document](../configuration/document-level) levels.

### Usage

Once a Lifecycle Identity has been configured, it will add the following metadata to your markdown file :

`id`: The unique Identifier that represents the specific instance of your document or cell.

`version`: The current version number on your document or cell is the version of Runme you are using.

Here is an sample of what the lifecycle identity on your file looks like:

```sh {"id":"01HFYHDGTT1BNMZD3CBCKHQGG0"}
runme:
  id: 01HFY0VFSB5F1PF7C28BW2YSVT
  version: v2.0
```

**Note**:
Each document or cell will have a unique identifier generated by Runme. Do not edit these to avoid conflicts.
