# Configuration

Runme  allows you to set how your markdown files should be executed using the configuration option. With this configuration, you can handle and manage your Runme execution and experience a smoother experience.

These configuration option includes:

1. [Cell-level Options](../configuration/cell-level)
2. [Document-level Options](../configuration/document-level)

You can change the configuration option at anytime, by making the desired change at the cell or document level (depends on the configuration you want to set)

In addition, Runme supports shebang to run all sorts of languages, allowing you to execute a wide range of languages. So whether you are working with Python, Bash or any executable language command, it executes your command.
