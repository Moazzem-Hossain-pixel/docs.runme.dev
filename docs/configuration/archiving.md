# Archiving Feature in Runme

The Archiving feature in Runme is designed to provide a robust solution for storing and managing the outputs generated from markdown shells. This feature is essential for preserving outputs for future reference or as historical data points. It leverages the Runme Cloud, ensuring secure and accessible storage.

## How to Utilize the Archiving Feature

### Prerequisites
**Auto-Save or Manual Save**: Ensure that the outputs you wish to archive are either saved automatically (if the [Auto-Save](../configuration/auto-save) feature is enabled) or manually saved to the RunMe Cloud.

## Archiving in the Runme Cloud Web Experience
Accessing Saved Outputs: After the shell outputs are saved to the cloud, navigate to the Runme Cloud Web interface.
