## The Problems

As a developer you jump around a lot of projects on regular basis. As every project is different, it always takes some time to understand how to navigate through the setup, e.g. how to compile the code or how to run the tests.

## How is Runme different?

Runme is a human-centric approach to providing and consuming code repository documentation. It's designed to progressively bridge the widening developer experience gaps in a cloud-native age. Gaps such as low integration between building blocks employed to deliver apps and services, error-prone copy&paste-management of dev environments, docs that have fallen behind undetect, and the vault lines of commonplace tools which were designed for machines not humans.
