Runme notebooks are special as they don't run Python code like [Jupiter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) would do. They allow you to define shell commands that help developers to get up and running with your project.

To get started with a new notebook, just create a simple markdown file. Runme will automatically open a notebook view that allows to add markdown or code cells.
