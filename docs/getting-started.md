# Getting Started ‚ö°Ô∏è
[![Open with Runme](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20with/Runme/5B3ADF?icon=https://runme.dev/img/logo.svg)](vscode://stateful.runme?command=setup&fileToOpen=docs/getting-started.md&repository=https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev.git)

üìú Runme lets you seamlessly turn your existing Markdown docs, such as README.md, into runnable notebooks.

‚èØ Runme enables static docs to become interactive for its readers and greatly improve their learning experience.

üë©‚Äçüíª As a VS Code user, just [click here](vscode://stateful.runme?command=setup&fileToOpen=docs/getting-started.md&repository=https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev.git) to *run this getting started guide*.

### Installation

Open and search `runme` from within the Extension Panel inside VS Code or click-to-install from the Marketplace:

* VS Code's official Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stateful.runme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stateful.runme)

* Open VSX Registry: [https://open-vsx.org/extension/stateful/runme](https://open-vsx.org/extension/stateful/runme)

## Why Runme? üí°

While markdown docs are ubiquitous in software and the written word foundational to documentation, bit-rot and "broken docs" are all too commonplace. The low coupling between documentation's static text and the code of the documented system exposes our docs to breakage. Runme is here to address this fundamental problem. Runme's goal is to makes existing markdown docs both **runnable** and subsequently **testable**. Much in the same way how unit tests relates to your code.

## Jump Right In üöÄ

Just [open this guide](vscode://stateful.runme?command=setup&fileToOpen=docs/getting-started.md&repository=https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev.git) as notebook inside VS Code to experience Runme first-hand.

### Inside VS Code

```sh { background=false interactive=false }
export MY_NAME=Enter your name
$ echo "Hi $MY_NAME, just let Runme run your docs for you."
```

### In The Terminal

Alternatively, you could use Runme's CLI in your terminal. On MacOS:

```sh
$ brew install stateful/tap/runme
$ runme --filename getting-started.md
```

Check [Runme's releases page](https://github.com/stateful/runme/releases) to download the CLI for all other platforms.

## What You Need To Know üë©‚Äçüè´

Runme turns arbitrary markdown files into runnable notebooks. If your markdown contains [fenced-code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) with shell-compatible commands, Runme is your friend. You most commonly find these in `README.md`, `DEV.md`, `BUILD.md`, etc but is up to your preference.

### Specify Language in Code/Command Blocks

Runme, just like most Markdown viewers, will work best without ambiguity what language is contained inside of fenced code blocks. If possible, always specify the language [according to the standard](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting) and illustrated below.

<pre>
```sh<br/>
$ echo "language identifier in fenced code block"<br/>
```
</pre>

> Out-of-the box, Runme will leverag the [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) Machine Learning (AI) model with a biasing function to detect the languages for unidentified code blocks. While this works well in a lot of cases, the accuracy is nowhere near 100%.

## Key Features ü¶æ

- Execute command blocks via a simple Ô∏è‚èØ play button instead of copy&paste-ing into your terminal
- Leverage placeholder and prompts to have readers interactively complete ENV VARs
- Fine-tune your doc's executable notebook cells to streamline the execution experience for others
- Run watchers for compilation/bundling in as background tasks
- Capture non-interactive output directly inside the respective notebook's cell output
- Control whether or not a cell's terminal should remain open after successful execution
- Use language identifiers in fenced code blocks to forgo language detection and higher reliability
- Set a cell's output MIME type to render images, JSON, or any other format in human-compatible ways
